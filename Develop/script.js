//start with the list of vars connected to the html elements 
//note i will be using jQueary for this project 

//next i will need the current day/date and time to display in the header 


//i will need the hours divided up into an 8 hour day
//these hour blocks will need to be standard buisness hours
// the current hour will need to be a light blue (cuz it would look nicer than danger red)
//the passed hours will need to be grey
//next the future hours will need to be green
//this means i will need to CREATE HTML ELEM

//IF i input an appointment/event into an hour block,
//THEN that input will stay there via local storage 
//and add a message in green saying save was sucsessfull 
//this means i will need a save button on each hour block 

//meaning the HTML elements created will need to have the including 
//a label with a var of time 
//an imput field that doubles as a display text field with a class
//and last but not least the save button
//it looks like in the gif they are using a photo on the btn so look into that
//if that doesnt workout than just use words
